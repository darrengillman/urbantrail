                <p class="lead">We think the Halifax Urban Trail will appeal both to seasoned club runners and to those who've more recently taken up running. We welcome slower runners.</p>
                
                <p>The race distance is a little over 10K, and we anticipate that you'll find it somewhat more challenging than a typical 10K road race. This is partly because there will be a lot of steps and flights of stairs to tackle. In addition, the race route to the Beacon Hill viewpoint which you will get to at about three kilometres involves steady climbing from the start. The race as a whole involves about 300m of climb.</p>
                
                <p>There is no time cut-off, but we do expect all runners to be able to complete the course within two hours. Apologies, but this isn't an event designed for walkers (and our volunteer marshals along the route deserve to be able to get home in good time for the rest of the Bank Holiday).</p>
                
                <p>The route is unfortunately not suitable for wheelchair athletes. If you're an athlete with other disabilities, you're invited to contact the race director before booking, using the email <a href="mailto:halifaxurbantrail@gmail.com">halifaxurbantrail@gmail.com</a>, to discuss whether the race would be one you'll be able to enjoy.</p>

                <h2>Safety</h2>
                <p>We need to ensure that all our runners have both an enjoyable and safe time. The course will be well marshalled and professional medical service provision will be there on the course and at the finish.</p>
                
                <p>By entering the race you agree to follow instructions given to you by the course marshals. (If you don't follow instructions, the risk of a DQ looms – so please do as you're asked). Marshals will try to help you safely across the road crossings, but they do not have powers to stop traffic.</p>
                
                <p>On the descent into Halifax there are two steeper sections of track with stone setts, which can be slippery particularly in wet weather. You will be advised when you are approaching these by signage. We ask you to take appropriate care. (We suggest trail shoes or road shoes with good gripping).</p>
                
                <p>For safety reasons, we are not allowing headphones to be worn by runners. See <a href="faqs.html">FAQs</a> for more on this, and also on the race ban on dogs and buggies.</p>
                
                <p>This is a race held under an England Athletics licence, so the usual EA rules for races apply.</p>

                <h2>How to book</h2>
                <p>When you're ready to book, you'll find the booking form here [LINK]. The cost is £25, with the usual £2 discount for EA-registered runners.</p>
