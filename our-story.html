                <p class="lead">The story of Halifax Urban Trail really begins in the small Breton town of Fougères. Like many French towns, Fougères has its own annual trail urbain in which in recent years a number of members of Todmorden Harriers who've been passing through on cycling holidays have participated.</p>
                
                <p>Our race director Andrew Bibby, a long-standing member of Tod Harriers, was there in 2024 and enjoyed the quirkiness of the race so much (the run round the chateau ramparts, the visit to the church and theatre, the final run-in through a disused railway tunnel) that he thought this was an idea which simply had to be brought to Halifax. After all, Halifax is a town with so much to offer in terms of historic buildings – as you'll find out!</p>
                
                <p>The 2026 inaugural Halifax Urban Trail has been put together by a team of Tod Harriers members with support from other local running clubs. It's a non-commercial race, and we're running it under the auspices of a new registered charity, set up specifically for the purpose.</p>
                
                <p>We're looking forward to a memorable day for everyone, as well as raising much needed funds for our local hospice, Overgate.</p>

                    <h2>French Inspiration</h2>
                    <p>Urban trails (trails urbains) have become incredibly popular across France, offering runners the unique opportunity to explore their towns and cities in ways that wouldn't normally be possible. These races typically feature:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Running through historic buildings and landmarks</li>
                        <li>Access to normally restricted areas</li>
                        <li>A celebration of local heritage and architecture</li>
                        <li>Community involvement and support</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We've taken this wonderful concept and adapted it perfectly for Halifax, showcasing our town's incredible industrial heritage and stunning architecture.</p>

                    <p>We want the Halifax Urban Trail to become an annual celebration of our town's unique character, bringing together the running community while supporting vital local causes. This inaugural race is just the beginning of what we hope will become a cherished tradition.</p>
