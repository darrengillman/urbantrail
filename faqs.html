                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Is the race measured?</h3>
                        <p>No, the race distance is a little over 10K. You'll also be running up and down a lot of flights of stairs, so this is not the race to achieve your 10K PB.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Where does the race start?</h3>
                        <p>The Halifax Urban Trail begins and ends in beautiful Shibden Park, once the parkland where Anne Lister – Gentleman Jack – enjoyed strolling.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>How do I get to Shibden Park?</h3>
                        <p>Shibden Park is just off the main A58 road between Halifax and Bradford. If you are driving, we hope you will share your car with others. You need to be aware that, if you are coming from the east (Bradford side), you will not be able to turn left into the park. Continue almost into Halifax town centre and then follow the brown signs to Shibden Park (NOT Shibden Hall – this is important!) to double back.</p>
                        <p>You can turn right directly into Shibden Park from the A58 coming from the west.</p>
                        <p>Parking is available for about two hundred cars in Shibden Park, for the standard parking tariff from the council (currently c. £1 an hour).</p>
                        <p>If you're planning on using public transport, Halifax has trains from Leeds, Bradford, Manchester and Preston as well as from London (although you'd need to come up from London the day before, and please check bank holiday train arrangements). Shibden Park is about 1.5 miles from the station, using the pavement beside the A58.</p>
                        <p>Bus times are notorious for changing, but we expect there to be a bus from Halifax bus station which will be leaving at about 8.30 and will pass the entrance to the park, and which should you get you to registration in time. But please check.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Where can people watch the race?</h3>
                        <p>We're recommending that family and friends gather in Halifax's amazing Piece Hall, where there will be a good view of the runners as they arrive. We are advised that, as well as the usual shops and cafes in the Piece Hall, there will also be an Easter Market taking place.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I run with my dog?</h3>
                        <p>We're afraid not – the race will be run under the England Athletics rule book, and dogs are not allowed.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I run with headphones?</h3>
                        <p>No, same answer as above, England Athletics prohibit most types of headphones in their races and we're choosing to extend this to all types of headphone. It's a safety thing.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I run with a buggy?</h3>
                        <p>No, once again, since we are an official England Athletics race, we can't allow buggies. (And would you really want to carry them up and down all those flights of stairs?)</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I do this as a sponsored run?</h3>
                        <p>You certainly can, and Overgate Hospice will be delighted if you can support them in this way.</p>
                        <p>You could, for example, get sponsorship for each step or stair you run up or down. We haven't done an exact count, but 200 is a close approximation.</p>
                        <p>There's more information here on how to create a Just Giving page for Overgate. [LINK]</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Is there an age limit?</h3>
                        <p>Runners need to be at least eighteen years of age on the day of the race.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Is there a time cut-off?</h3>
                        <p>There isn't, although we are expecting runners to be able to complete the course in two hours. See <a href="race-entry.html">Race Entry</a> for more details.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Is the race timed?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, your race number will have a timing chip. Your position and time will be online almost as soon as you cross the finish line.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Can I run in fancy dress?</h3>
                        <p>Of course! Rhinos welcome.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Are there prizes?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, for the first three runners in the male/open and female categories, and then prizes in vet categories too. Prize giving will be at the finish, around 11.30am.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>Are there mementoes?</h3>
                        <p>We're planning to give everyone who completes the race a special memento to accompany your memories of the event.</p>
                        <p>Because we don't like seeing race T-shirts not being worn or being discarded before they're worn out, there won't be T-shirts given out automatically. Sorry. But for those who want one we are commissioning a really attractive Halifax Urban Trail T-shirt, and you'll be able to order this when you sign up for the race. (Note that T-shirt orders are only possible at this point). See <a href="sustainability.html">Sustainability</a> for more details.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <h3>And after the race?</h3>
                        <p>There is plenty going on locally to enable you to enjoy the rest of the Bank Holiday. Having run through Halifax town centre, you may want to return to explore the shops, museums and historic buildings in a more leisurely fashion.</p>
                        <p>Even closer to the race finish is Shibden Hall, and this fascinating old house will be open for visitors after the race, if you want to combine a day of running with a little bit of history.</p>
