                        <p>As we mention in the <a href="faqs.html">FAQs</a>, we want to avoid giving out unwanted T-shirts which then lurk in drawers or, worse, end in landfill sites. We're asking you to decide when you register whether you want a commemorative technical T-shirt and to pay for it at that point. We're commissioning stylish T-shirts from a specialist company who make their clothing from recycled material (but you wouldn't know the material was recycled, honest!)</p>
